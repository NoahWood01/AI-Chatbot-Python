uses the following modules:

nltk
numpy
tflearn
tensorflow
random
json
pickle

To retrain the chatbot:
1. delete .pickle file
2. uncomment the 'x' in try: so that the old data is not used
3. run once (it probably will fail)
4. run again and it should show the new training trials
5. recomment the 'x' so it does not retrain each time it is run
