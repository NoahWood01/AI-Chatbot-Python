# AI-Chatbot-Python
 
Step 1:
Create training so that the Chatbot can learn from existing sentences/text.
    Use tflearn with varying interations to learn from the given .json file.

Step 2:
use the training in order to have the Chatbot respond with high probability.
    for right now a lot of topics will not have the "correct" response.

Step 3:
Create a GUI for the Chatbot so that it works outside of the command prompt/IDE.

Step 4:
Figure out a way to supply more text to the training so that the Chatbot can respond and correctly recognize more question and text.
